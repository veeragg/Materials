- - - - - - - - - - VARIABLES - - - - - - - - - - - -

- javas primitive data types are int, char, double, boolean 
- String, on the other hand is a literal or an object
- java has also escape sequeces, that have alternative uses in print statements:
--> \" allows you to print " character, \\ will print one backslash, \n will continue printing on another line
- If you want a value that cannot be changet later on, you need to initialize it with a keyword final.


- - - - - - - - - - CLASSES - - - - - - - - - - - -

- the public keyword is an access level mofidier, which allows other classes to interact with it
- the constructor needs to be named like the class itself
- you can create it without or with parameters
- you can create an instance of that class by: Class newinstance = new Class();
- while creating an object, the constructor sets its initial state, which is made up of data representing the objects characteristics.
- you can overload the constructor, meaning that you can create several constructors with different parameters 
- A formal parameter specifies the type and name of data that can be passed into a method
- An actual parameter, or argument, refers to the value being passed during a method call
- the formal parameter will be initialized with the actual parameters value
- you can also set values for variables in the class's body
- the dot notation is used to access the instances

public class Store {
  String productType;                   // instance fields
 
  public Store(String product) {        //constructor method 
    productType = product;              // a way to initialize a formal parameter
  }
  Store cookieShop = new Store("cookies"); //lets create an object
  
  
  - - - - - - - - - - METHODS - - - - - - - - - - - -
  
  - In java, you can create your own methods, just like constructors
  - using different parameters, methods can be overloaded too
  - Because objects are reflective parameters, sometimes they can return their memory place instead of the value it contains
  - Instead, we can add a toString() method that will print the wanted string. 
  For example: 
     public String toString(){
       return "This is a " + color + " car!";
   }
   
     
     
  - - - - - - - - - - CONDITIONALS - - - - - - - - - - - -
  
  - the most simple conditionl statement in java is the if-else statement
  - you can check multiple conditions by creating nested loops or using the && operator
  - the second conditional statement is the switch statement.
  - For example: 
  String course = "History";
 
switch (course) { 
  case "Algebra":        // Enroll in Algebra
    break; 
  case "Biology":       // Enroll in Biology
    break;
  default:
    System.out.println("Course not found");
}
