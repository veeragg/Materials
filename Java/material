- javas primitive data types are int, char, double, boolean 
- String, on the other hand is a literal or an object
- java has also escape sequeces, that have alternative uses in print statements:
--> \" allows you to print " character, \\ will print one backslash, \n will continue printing on another line
- If you want a value that cannot be changet later on, you need to initialize it with a keyword final.


- - - - - - - - - - CLASSES - - - - - - - - - - - -

- the public keyword is an access level mofidier, which allows other classes to interact with it
- the constructor needs to be named like the class itself
- you can create it without or with parameters
- you can create an instance of that class by: Class newinstance = new Class();
- while creating an object, the constructor sets its initial state, which is made up of data representing the objects characteristics.
- you can overload the constructor, meaning that you can create several constructors with different parameters 
- A formal parameter specifies the type and name of data that can be passed into a method
- An actual parameter, or argument, refers to the value being passed during a method call
- the formal parameter will be initialized with the actual parameters value
- you can also set values for variables in the class's body
- the dot notation is used to access the instances

public class Store {
  String productType;                   // instance fields
 
  public Store(String product) {        //constructor method 
    productType = product;              // a way to initialize a formal parameter
  }
  Store cookieShop = new Store("cookies"); //lets create an object
