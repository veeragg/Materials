- - - - - - - - - - VARIABLES - - - - - - - - - - - -

- javas primitive data types are int, char, double, boolean 
- String, on the other hand is a literal or an object
- java has also escape sequeces, that have alternative uses in print statements:
--> \" allows you to print " character, \\ will print one backslash, \n will continue printing on another line
- If you want a value that cannot be changet later on, you need to initialize it with a keyword final.


- - - - - - - - - - CLASSES - - - - - - - - - - - -

- the public keyword is an access level mofidier, which allows other classes to interact with it
- the constructor needs to be named like the class itself
- you can create it without or with parameters
- you can create an instance of that class by: Class newinstance = new Class();
- while creating an object, the constructor sets its initial state, which is made up of data representing the objects characteristics.
- you can overload the constructor, meaning that you can create several constructors with different parameters 
- A formal parameter specifies the type and name of data that can be passed into a method
- An actual parameter, or argument, refers to the value being passed during a method call
- the formal parameter will be initialized with the actual parameters value
- you can also set values for variables in the class's body
- the dot notation is used to access the instances

public class Store {
  String productType;                   // instance fields
 
  public Store(String product) {        //constructor method 
    productType = product;              // a way to initialize a formal parameter
  }
  Store cookieShop = new Store("cookies"); //lets create an object
  
  
  - - - - - - - - - - METHODS - - - - - - - - - - - -
  
  - In java, you can create your own methods, just like constructors
  - using different parameters, methods can be overloaded too
  - Because objects are reflective parameters, sometimes they can return their memory place instead of the value it contains
  - Instead, we can add a toString() method that will print the wanted string. 
  For example: 
     public String toString(){
       return "This is a " + color + " car!";
   }
   - A method that returns an array is constructed like this: public String[] IReturnArrays(){
   }
   
     
    - - - - - - - - - - CONDITIONALS - - - - - - - - - - - -
  
  - the most simple conditionl statement in java is the if-else statement
  - you can check multiple conditions by creating nested loops or using the && operator
  - the second conditional statement is the switch statement.
  - For example: 
  String course = "History";
 
switch (course) { 
  case "Algebra":        // Enroll in Algebra
    break; 
  case "Biology":       // Enroll in Biology
    break;
  default:
    System.out.println("Course not found");
}


  - - - - - - - - - - ARRAYS - - - - - - - - - - - -
  
  - you can create an array by defining the datatype it holds, adding brackets and the name of the array:
  - For example: int[] prices = {2,4,5,1}
  - import java.util.Arrays; has the toString method for importing 
  - You can also create empty arrays by defining their sizes. Note that the size cannot be changed afterwards. 
--> int[] my_ages = new int[5]; 
- the new keyword initializes all of the values as 0. In string the value would be null.
- the classic constucor: main(String[] args) 
--> the string[] represents a normal string and the args represents the arguments passed in from the terminal to that string
- example of comparing the string:     else if(args[0].equals("Human"))
  
  
    - - - - - - - - - - STRING METHODS - - - - - - - - - - - -
    
    - java has a class that contains various string methods
    - .length() returns the length of the string,
    - concat() creates a new string by adding another string to the first strings end
    - equals() compares if the strings are the same, equalsIgnoreCase does the same but doesnt consider upper or lower case letters
    - .indexOf("a") will return the index of the letter a
    - .charAt(1) returns the char at the index 2
    - .substring(2,10) will return a new string between the old strings indexes 2 and 10
  
  
- - - - - - - - - - ENCAPSULATION AND STATIC METHODS - - - - - - - - - - - -
      
- private and public are keywords that can be used to control the accessibility of variables and classes
- classes can be private too but it is very uncommon, they are usually set to public
- you can create an object from a class by --> ClassName objectName = new Classname(variables);
- getters are accessor methods that are used to access the values of private variables
- setters are mutator mmethods that are used to change the values of private variables
-
-   public int getBalance(){                 //example getter
    return balance; }
  
  public void setBalance(int newBalance){    //example setter
    balance = newBalance; }
    
- an instance variable is a variable that contains a value for an object, local variable is a variable declared in a class
- if these variables have the same name, you can access the instance variable by using the this. keyword
- this always refers to the object we are using
- you can use this as a parameter when you are calling a method with this and you want to give the object as the methods parameter
-->   this.pairWithOtherComputer(this);  //here the object that called this function will also be its variable
 
- public void resetSettings(){               // here we havent create an object so we use this to access the other methods
    this.setBrightness(0);                   // when you use this, it will be replaced by the object that calls the resetSettings function
    this.setVolume(0); }
    
- private methods can also be helpers, for example one public method can contain many smaller private functions that all get called at the same time
- helpers are used by larger methods


- - - - - - - - - - THE MATH CLASS - - - - - - - - - - - -

- using non-static members you need to create an object of that class before you can call its methods
- with static methods you can just call them by the dot notation or import the package and using the function name

- the math package can be imported by --> import static java.lang.Math.*;
- int abs(x) returns the absolute value of x
- int pow(int base, int exponent) returns the first parameter in the second parameters exponent
- int b = (int)(Math.random() * 10); will return an int typed number between 0 and 9, whithout the *10 it would return between 0.0 and 1.0 by default
- you can set the range by using this alogrithm --> (Math.random() * (maxValue - minValue + 1)) + minValue
- for example, int d = (int)(Math.random() * 11 ) + 10; returns a number between 10 and 20 
- all of javas mathematical methods can be found here -->  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html


- - - - - - - - - - STATIC METHODS AND VARIABLES - - - - - - - - - - - -

- Static variables belong to the whole class and are the same for all objects 
- they can be created by    -->   public static String genus = "Canis";
- Integer.MAX_VALUE is a static method that returns the largest possible integer

- static methods can be created like any other methods, just add the static keyword
    --> public static void myFirstStaticMethod(){ }
    
- you can also declare setters and getters for these methods, use the static keyword in them too
- static methods cant access non-static instance variables, or the this keyword! 



- - - - - - - - - - INHERITANCE - - - - - - - - - - - -

- You can set a child class to inherit the parent class by adding the keyword extends
- class Triangle extends Shape { } --> here class triangle will inherit the shape class

-  Triangle() {                          Triangle() {
    this.numSides = 3;}                   super(3);}
- these codes represent a subclass triangle that is calling it parentclass's constructor, they do the exactly same thing
- you can modify the parameters in the parent class's constructor
- you can also call the parent class's other methods by using the super keyword, just use the dot notation 
--> super.parentMethod();

- If you add a final keyword before the class member, child classes cannot modify it
- By using a wrapper @override, you can rewrite the parent class's methods 


- - - - - - - - - - DEBUGGING - - - - - - - - - - - -

- syntax errors are grammar errors and are the easiest to fix 
- run-time errors are errors that occur while the program is trying to execute
- java uses exceptions to describe the errors
- heres how you can try to handle errors -->

try {                                    // defines a block being tested for errors while executing
} catch (NullPointerException e) {       // will be executed if an error occurs
 
  System.err.println("NullPointerException: " + e.getMessage()); }    // this will print to the standard error and in red 

- logic errors are happening when the code is running, but it doesn't produce the wanted result



- - - - - - - - - - TWO DIMENSIONAL ARRYAS - - - - - - - - - - - -

- 2D arrays are useful for storing and mapping data, although they can not be changed after they have been initialized

- int[][] intArray2;                          // a two dimensional array created
intArray2 = new int[3][5];                    // initializing the array with 3 rows and 5 columns
OR int intArray2[][] = new int[3][5];

double[][] doubleValues = {{1.5, 2.6, 3.7}, {7.5, 6.4, 5.3}, {9.8,  8.7, 7.6}, {3.6, 5.7, 7.8}};         //new 2D array created and initialized 
String[][] stringValues;
stringValues = new String[][] {{"working", "with"}, {"2D", "arrays"}, {"is", "fun"}};                    //new 2D array created and initialized

- datatype variableName = existing2DArray[row][column];    //here is how you can access a specific value in the array
- twoDArray[1][3] = 150;                                   // changing a value is done similarly

- if you want to know the heigth of a matrix array         --> matrixArray.length();
- and the width of the array                               --> matrixArray[0].length();
- though, in some cases the rows can have different widths 
- loops can be used to iterate through both of the arrays

-for example,
		for(int i=0; i<intMatrix.length; i++) {
			for(int j = 0; j < intMatrix[i].length; j++) } //the inner loop will iterate fully for each element of the outer loop
      
      int i = 0, j=0;
while(i<charData.length) {
    j = 0;
    while(j<charData[i].length) {
        System.out.print(charData[i][j] + " ");
        j++;
    }
    System.out.println();
    i++;
}
