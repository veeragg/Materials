- - - - - - - - - - VARIABLES - - - - - - - - - - - -

- javas primitive data types are int, char, double, boolean 
- String, on the other hand is a literal or an object
- java has also escape sequeces, that have alternative uses in print statements:
--> \" allows you to print " character, \\ will print one backslash, \n will continue printing on another line
- If you want a value that cannot be changet later on, you need to initialize it with a keyword final.


- - - - - - - - - - CLASSES - - - - - - - - - - - -

- the public keyword is an access level mofidier, which allows other classes to interact with it
- the constructor needs to be named like the class itself
- you can create it without or with parameters
- you can create an instance of that class by: Class newinstance = new Class();
- while creating an object, the constructor sets its initial state, which is made up of data representing the objects characteristics.
- you can overload the constructor, meaning that you can create several constructors with different parameters 
- A formal parameter specifies the type and name of data that can be passed into a method
- An actual parameter, or argument, refers to the value being passed during a method call
- the formal parameter will be initialized with the actual parameters value
- you can also set values for variables in the class's body
- the dot notation is used to access the instances

public class Store {
  String productType;                   // instance fields
 
  public Store(String product) {        //constructor method 
    productType = product;              // a way to initialize a formal parameter
  }
  Store cookieShop = new Store("cookies"); //lets create an object
  
  
  - - - - - - - - - - METHODS - - - - - - - - - - - -
  
  - In java, you can create your own methods, just like constructors
 
  - using different parameters, methods can be overloaded too
  
  
  
  
  
public class Store {
  // instance fields
  String productType;
  double price;
  
  // constructor method
  public Store(String product, double initialPrice) {
    productType = product;
    price = initialPrice;
  }
  
  // increase price method
  public void increasePrice(double priceToAdd){
    double newPrice = price + priceToAdd;
    price = newPrice;
  }
  
  // get price with tax method
  public double getPriceWithTax(){
    double tax = 0.08;
    double totalPrice = price + price*tax;
    return totalPrice;
  }
  
  public String toString(){
    return "This store sells " + productType + " at a price of " + price + ".";
  }

  // main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Store lemonadeStand = new Store("Lemonade", 3.75);
    Store cookieShop = new Store("Cookies", 5);

    System.out.println(lemonadeStand);
    System.out.println(cookieShop);
  }
}
