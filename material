- - - - - - - - - - - - INTRODUCTION - - - - - - - - - - - - -

- here are few links to learn about kotlin
--> https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html
--> https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide
- functions are declared with the fun keyword
- println prints on another line, print keeps printing on the same line
- comments are similar to java: with // or /*
- Kotlin doesn't use semocolons! 


- - - - - - - - - - - - DATA TYPES AND VARIABLES - - - - - - - - - - - - -

- kotlin supports ints, strings, booleans, chars
- a variable is defined a bit differently                                                               --> var dogName: String = "Lucifer"
- you dont have to initialize the value at once, it can be done later by                                --> dogName = "Lucifer"
- if you want an immutable variable, just replace var with val
- you can use variable inference(when you don't specify the type) and the compiler will guess it

- print("${typeTest::class.simpleName}") --> will return the type of the value 
- an emoji is a string consisting of unicode characters
- concatenating strings is done the same way as in java, with a plus notation
- you can also use templates                                                                             --> Template: "Hello, $variableName!"
- if you want to use an input, readline is the function for that                                         --> val myColor = readLine()

- kotlin has various number types that have different sizes. For example, long, int, double, short
- kotlin supports all of the basic arithmetic operations
- the math libary contains some more complex mathematical equations (pow, min, random, round)



- - - - - - - - - - - - CONDITIONALS - - - - - - - - - - - - -

- IF:
if (raining) {
  println("Bring an umbrella.") 
} else{
  println("put on a dress")  }

- kotlin has all the generic logical operations
- you can nest conditional statements 

if (sailColor == "red") {
  println("Follow the lower river.")
  if (sailPattern == "striped") {
    println("Then take the right path.")
  }
  
 - WHEN :
when (letter) {                                                        //specifying the compared variable
  in 'a'..'m' -> println("Letter is in 1st half of alphabet.")         // .. is used to declare a range (here between a and m)
  in 'n'..'z' -> println("Letter is in 2nd half of alphabet.")         // in is used to check if something is in a list
  else -> println("Not a valid value")
}

- - - - - LISTS
- Creating a list --> var/val listName = listOf(value1, value2, value3)
- listOf creates an immutable list, with var you can make the variable contain another list, but the content cannot change
- you can access the list's elements by their index --> listName[0]
-
