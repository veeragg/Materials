-THREE WAYS OF USING CSS
--> inline style                 <p style='color: red; font-size: 20px;'>I'm learning to code!</p>

--> internal stylesheet 
<head>
  <title>Vacation World</title>
  <style>
    p {
      color:green;
    }
    </style>
</head>

--> linking the css file         <link href='./style.css' rel='stylesheet'>



- an universal type selector that targets all the elements 
             *{
             border: 1px solid red; }


- you can choose a class element by:
-->         <p class='brand'>Sole Shoe Company</p>
-->         .brand { }


p:hover {                                                      //hover is a pseudo-class, when you hover your mouse above the text 
  background-color: lime;                                      //the backround color will turn lime
} 
--> other pseudo classes are :focus, :visited, :disabled, and :active



h1, 
.menu {                                                        //here you have chosen class element menu and all h1 to be a specific font
  font-family: Georgia;
}

- making text uppercase     -->       text-transform: uppercase;
- making the text cursive   -->       font-family: cursive;
- border to a text or img   -->       border: 1px solid red;
- text color                -->       color:green;
- takes the href elements   -->       [href]{    color: magenta;    }
- takes a specific image    -->       img[src*='winter'] {                  //finds an image with 'winter' in the address
- targets link addresses    -->       a[href*='florence'] {
- sets a backround color    -->       background-color: aqua;
- chooses special classes h1 ->       h1.special {     }
- gets all li:s from mainlist >       .main-list li {     }
- targeting values with id  -->       #banner {     }

- you can change the text display by using                       -->        font-family: Helvetica
- font size can be modified using pixels, for example            -->        font-size: 18px
- regulating the thinness/boldness of text                       -->        font-weight: bold;     (has also value normal)
- aligns text on the screen                                      -->        text-align: right;     (left, right, center, justify)
- choosing color is made with these commands                     -->        color: red;
                                                                            background-color: blue;
- the opacity(visibility) can be changed with opacity(fading)    -->        opacity: 0.5;
- overriding all other rules with important                      -->        color: blue !important;
- targeting size                                                 -->        height: 18px   ->    widht: 25px  (can be 100%)
- targeting the border (width, style color)                      -->        border: 3px solid coral;
- curving the borders corners                                    -->        border-radius: 5px;
- targeting the padding                                          -->        padding: 15px
- targeting the margin (outside the border)                      -->        margin: 25px
- setting limits to size                                         -->        min-width:300px;  ->   max-width: 500px;
- a default value for overflowing content (visible)              -->        overflow: visible; 

--> the width can be pixels or thin, thick, medium / there are 10 styles / there are 140 built-in colors
--> you can create a circle by making height and width the same, border-radius 50%
--> you can change the padding on all sides -> padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-right, padding-left
--> padding: 6px 11px 4px 9px; (targets top, right, left, bottom)
--> padding: 5px 10px 20px;    (targets top, left/right, bottom)
--> padding: 5px 10px;         (targets top/bottom, left/right)
--> margin can also be set for all the sides, similarly to the padding 
--> horisontal margins add up, vertical ones collapse
--> overflow also has values: scroll and hidden 


- changing the elements backround 
-> .main-banner {
  background-image: url('images/mountains.jpg');
  }
  
- width: 400px;                     //in order to center an element, the width needs to be implemented
  margin: 0 auto;                   // this sets the top and bottom margin to 0 and centers the element automatically
  
- * {                               //like here you can reset the box-model in order to avoid sizing issues and overflowing
  box-sizing: border-box;           // you can also set margin and padding to 0 at the start of the file, for all elements
}

-------------POSITION 

- you can change an elements default position                --> position: static   (default value)

.green-box {
  background-color: green;       
  position: relative;              //we can position the element in relation to its default position
  top: 50px;                       // will move the element 50px down
  left: 120px;                     // will move the element 120px to the right
}

position: absolute;             //will place the element relative to the closest parent element (other elements will ignore it) 
                                //you can specify the position with top, right etc. It will move when the user is scrolling
                                
.title {
  position: fixed;              //you can set an element to be fixed, it wont move when scrolling, for example a navigation bar
  top: 0px;
  left: 0px;
}

.box-bottom {
  position: sticky;             //the position will move while scrolling, but then sticking to a specific location               
  top: 240px;
}

-  z-index: 1;                 //tells the depth of an element and decides which one will be layered on the website
                               //the higher the index, lower numbers wont come on top of it 


-------------DISPLAY

- display allows making every element inline, like a, em or strong's default value
- inline elements are wrapped in a thight box and can be directly next to each other, their height and width cannot be changed 

- block-level elements take the entire width of the page by default and are the height they need to display their content 
- these elements width can be made smaller 

- inline-block combines the inline and block. They can be next to each other and their size can be changed

- float: right;     //will move an element so far right as possible (left is also a value of float)
- you can use clear to make sure the elements don't bump into each other

- clear: left;      --> left side wont touch any other element (same for right) 
--> both    --> neither side will touch anything 
--> none    --> the element can touch all the sides

- in css, colors are represented by named colors and number combinations

- here you can find all the colors represented by hexadecimal numbers
--> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value

- rgb colors are represented by using decimal numbers         -->          color: rgb(23, 45, 23);
- rgb and hex colors contain the same colors. With rgb each number has a number 0-255 
- first represents the amount of red, the second green and the last one blue

- hsl means hue, saturation, lighteness        -->   color: hsl(120, 60%, 70%);
- hue means the angle on the color wheel, saturaty represents the purity and lightness darkness

-->  color: hsla(34, 100%, 50%, 0.1);        //you  can change the opacity 
--> the last value is the alpha. (1 is opaque, 0 is transparent)
- you can add the opacity to a rgb number and hx number aswell, with hex the opacity goes from 00 to FF
- you can also use color: transparent

- css has different kind of fonts, some are supported on most web sites
- Here you can find all the fonts available for css   -->    https://www.cssfontstack.com/

h1 {                                                      //this is a font stack, first the browser will try to use caslon
  font-family: Caslon, Georgia, 'Times New Roman';        //if it is not supported by the browser, then georgia and then times new roman
}

- there are serif and sans-serif fonts. Serif fonts have extra details on the main strokes of the letters
- you can add serif or sans-serif as keywords at tthe end of the stack. In case none of the fonts are available, some serif or else font will be used to display the content


-   font-weight: bold; 
--> here you can control how thin or bold the text appears. Other values are normal, bolder and lighter.
--> you can also use numerical values from 1 to 1000(700=bold), but this feature is not available for all fonts.


- font-style: italic;                 --> here the font has been changed to italics. The default value for font-style is normal. 
- text-transform: uppercase;          --> you can change the text either to uppercase or lowercase.
- letter-spacing: 2px;                --> each character will be 2 pixels apart from each other, you can use px or em
- word-spacing: 0.3em;                --> determines the space between words, em is recommended for words, but you can also use pixels
- line-height: 1.4;                   --> changes the height between the lines, values can be 1.4, 5%, em or px


- remember text_align above!!
- you can link free fonts from google etc. to your file using the <link> element
- another possibility is to use bought fonts that you link to the stylesheet using a relative path. (You need to host the files alongside your website)


- you can choose a free font from google fonts, for example and link it to your stylsheet with the <link> (add it to your <head>)
-->  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@100&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
--> after you need to specify the selected font in the stylesheet, like done above


- using @font-face you first need to download the wanted font to your computer. WOFF2 is the most progressive file type.

@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyParagraphFont';                                //custom font name 
  src: url('fonts/Roboto.woff2') format('woff2'),                // fonts linked through a relative link
       url('fonts/Roboto.woff') format('woff'),
       url('fonts/Roboto.ttf') format('truetype');
}
--> after linking the fonts, you need to specify them by using: font-family like stated before
